## API methods
# If your plugin implements API routes, then the 'api_routes' method needs
# to be implemented, returning valid OpenAPI 2.0 paths serialized as a hashref.
# It is a good practice to actually write OpenAPI 2.0 path specs in JSON on the
# plugin and read it here. This allows to use the spec for mainline Koha later,
# thus making this a good prototyping tool.
